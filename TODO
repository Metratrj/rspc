A middleware should be unable to return `impl Stream` if it's being put on a `query` or `subscription`???

Supporting file streaming over rspc


It would be nice if `rspc-core` could not depend on the whole `futures`

Export `Error` and `ExecError` from root of `rspc-core`
Can `Error` and `ExecError` now be merged???
